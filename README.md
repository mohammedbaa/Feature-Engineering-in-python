- `2-Handling-Imbalanced-Dataset.ipynb`: Methods to manage imbalanced datasets.
- `3-Smote-Oversampling.ipynb`: SMOTE oversampling techniques for imbalanced datasets.
- `4-Handling-Outliers.ipynb`: Identifying and treating outliers in data.
- `5-Data-Encoding-Nominal-One-Hot-Encoding.ipynb`: One-hot encoding for nominal categorical variables.
- `6-Label-and-Ordinal-Encoding.ipynb`: Label encoding and ordinal encoding techniques.
- `7-Target-Guided-Ordinal-Encoding.ipynb`: Custom encoding based on target variables.

## Data
- `data/raw/`: Contains the raw datasets.
- `data/processed/`: Processed datasets after preprocessing.

## Utilities
